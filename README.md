# Water footprint!
### Current as of 11/19/2022
</br>
## Files:
1. index.html (esentially empty)
2. water.csv (just all the data so far)

### notes:

* eventually going to split the data (some of the visualization data needs to be fixed)
    * example 1: we need viz 1 data to have water foorprint and calories per gallon/ calories per serving!

* someone needs to set up the HTML page and we also need some other text on the page
    * maybe a paragraph on what water footprint even means
    * maybe why water foot prints even matter (enviromental impact & human access to water)

* at some point someone is gonna have to format the html page but as for now I'm gonna add three SVG elements
    * maybe a logo for the project?
    * maybe a tool bar for more resources?

* I hope everyone knows how to use git with branches n stuff!
